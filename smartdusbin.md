After wiring and attaching all the devices and setting up to the Smart Dustbin, now observe all the important setup whether they are well connected or something missed. 
After connection set up now next step is to submit/upload code in Arduino and supply power to the circuit. 
When system is powered ON, Arduino keeps monitoring for any things that come near the sensor at give range. 
When Ultrasonic sensor detect any object for example like hand or others, here Arduino calculates its distance and if it less than a certain predefines value than servo motor get activate first and with the support of the extended arm of the lid. 

Lid will open for a given time than it will automatically close.
